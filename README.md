This repository is a work-in-progress port of [BountyBot](https://github.com/Trimatix/GOF2BountyBot) onto the [BASED](https://github.com/Trimatix/BASED) platform. The game's code has only partially been copied over, but is in a state of basic functionality.

# GOF2BountyBot
An ambitious discord bot written in python, recreating some of the features of Galaxy on Fire 2. Currently, the standout features are the bounty hunting system, and the items/loadout/trading/dueling system.

# Architecture
The 'main' file is `bot.bot`, which defines regular behaviour with `discord.Client.event`s.
Command definitions are located in the various modules of the `commands` package.

## cfg
This package configures the game's behaviour with BASED's automatic TOML config file generation, and a custom gameConfigurator script that parses a set of JSON game object descriptions.

## gameObjects
Contains definitions for all *game objects* - representing items useable by the players (items, inventories) and playing functionality of the game itself (shops, bounties, duels).

## shipRenderer
At its base, `_render.py `implements calls to [blender](https://www.blender.org/) to render a named model with a named texture file. `shipRenderer.py` makes use of this, passing renderer arguments to blender through the `render_args` plaintext file. `shipRenderer` is capable of compositing multiple textures according to image masks,using the `Pillow` library. All of this behaviour can be called asynchronously to render a given `Ship` with a series of texture files according to the ship's textureRegion masks, by using the `shipRenderer.renderShip` coroutine.

## userAlerts
Defines the versitile `UABase` class, which can be used to assign boolean alert subscriptions to alert behaviour, to be called upon certain events. For example, a guild may define a `UA_Shop_Refresh` alert, corresponding to a role within the guild. Users may then subscribe to this alert, granting them the role. The shop refreshing `TimedTask` expiry function is directed to check for the existence of such an alert in guilds, and ping the alerting role.
